        The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued new guidelines to all of its affiliate schools that will be administering class 10 and 12 board exams this year. According to the official notification, schools administering the board examination may only use plastic bags to package answer books before sending them to the relevant regional office via postal services.


Plastic bags will not be used if the sealed answer books are delivered to the regional office personally or with the assistance of the city coordinator. The CBSE has warned schools not to use WhatsApp messages to communicate with the board or any other official during the examination. Any comments on the question papers must be communicated to the board via the OECMS link shared by CBSE.
